Move And Resize HotKeys - Move and Resize windows in Microsoft Windows

Move And Resize is configured to run at Windows startup - for the current user.

The installer creates a shortcut in the Startup folder in the user's Windows Start Menu.
This enables Move And Resize HotKeys to run every time the user logs in.

To avoid the program running at Windows startup, remove the shortcut from the user's Startup folder, typically located in the following directory:

User's startup folder: 
C:\Users<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.
